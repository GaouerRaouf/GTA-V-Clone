Town Constructor Pack Short Manual

This pack contains all assets which you need to construct your own town.

There are several ways to build your town. You can always use premade buildings, just Drag&Drop in your scene. Or you can
make it harcore, using small chunks and Craft really unique urban town.


Several tips I want to Share, while working with this assets:

1) Always keep your scene clean and well organised. It will make lot of easier your life when scene becomes really big. (See Demo Scene for Example)
2) Set Snap settings on 1 for each dimension. I also suggest to set Rotation Snap on 45 degrees. Use pivot handlers to manipulate objects. 
3) Hold Ctrl key for grid movement. especially when moving modular parts.
4) while organizing your hierarchy keep in mind that, it's always good to have parent for each building.
5) When placing small chunk on scene, create empty first and place all modular parts in this game object. I will save your time
by resetting its 0 position to it's parent's coordinates.
6) While Optimising your performance don't forget to use Static batching for Pro license. However if u don't own pro license you always can
use Childe Combiner Script. Keep your Draw Calls reduced by combining static meshes.
7) All package are using only 3 Textures for Diffuse/Specular map. and 3 normal maps.
8) Before u start constructing RoofTops, check Premade Roofs first. If u don't plan to make something special, this prefabs can save a lot of time.
